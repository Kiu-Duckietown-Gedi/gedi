### Backlog
1.     Implement camera setup and calibration:
  *     Set up a camera system on the duckiebot.
  *      Perform camera calibration to ensure accurate perception.

2.    Object detection and recognition:
  *      Develop a model or utilize existing models for object detection.
  *      Train the model to detect duckiebots and ducks in the driving lane.
  *      Implement the object recognition algorithm on the duckiebot.

3.    Path planning and obstacle avoidance:
  *      Design a path planning algorithm that avoids detected obstacles.
  *      Integrate the object detection module with the path planning algorithm.
  *      Implement obstacle avoidance behaviors, such as steering away from obstacles or stopping if necessary.

4.    Testing and refinement:
  *      Conduct extensive testing in various scenarios to evaluate the obstacle avoidance capability.
  *      Refine the algorithms and parameters based on the test results to improve performance.

5.    Handling oncoming obstacles:
  *      Extend the obstacle avoidance capability to handle oncoming duckiebots or ducks.
  *      Implement appropriate strategies for safe navigation around oncoming obstacles.

6.    Integration and system optimization:
  *     Integrate the obstacle avoidance module with the overall duckiebot system.
  *     Optimize the performance of the obstacle avoidance algorithm for real-time operation.

7.    Documentation and reporting:
  *     Document the implementation details, including algorithm descriptions and system architecture.
  *     Prepare a report summarizing the project, including challenges faced and lessons learned.
